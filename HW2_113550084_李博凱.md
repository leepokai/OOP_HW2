# Library Management System

## Project Overview
This Library Management System is a C++ implementation that efficiently manages a collection of books using AVL trees for quick search and retrieval operations. The system maintains two separate AVL trees - one organized by book titles and another by publication years - providing optimal performance for different types of queries.

## Features
- **Book Management**: Add, remove, and search for books in the library
- **Efficient Search**: Find books by title or publication year
- **Book Circulation**: Check out and return books with user tracking
- **History Tracking**: Keep records of all borrowing activities
- **Book Information**: View comprehensive details about each book
- **Inventory Management**: Track available and total copies of each book

## Technical Implementation
- **Data Structures**: Self-balancing AVL trees for O(log n) search operations
- **Memory Management**: Proper resource allocation and deallocation
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Encapsulation of book and library functionalities

## System Requirements
- C++11 compatible compiler (g++ recommended)
- Make utility for build automation

## Installation and Compilation
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd HW2_113550084_李博凱

# Compile the project
mingw32-make

# Run the application
mingw32-make run

# Run the application if you in linux/mac
make run
```

## Project Structure
- [`include`](include ): Header files defining class structures
  - `book.h`: Book class definition
  - `library.h`: Library and AVLNode structure definitions
- [`src`](src ): Implementation files
  - `book.cpp`: Implementation of Book class methods
  - `library.cpp`: Implementation of Library class methods
  - `main.cpp`: Main program with user interface
- [`makefile`](makefile ): Build automation script

## Usage
The application provides a text-based menu interface with the following options:
1. Add a new book
2. Search for a book by published year
3. Check out a book
4. Return a book
5. List all books
6. Search by book title
7. View book borrow history
8. Remove a book
9. Exit

## Implementation Details
- Books are stored as nodes in two AVL trees for efficient retrieval
- Each book tracks its own borrowing history
- The library maintains a global borrowing history across all books
- AVL tree rotations maintain balanced trees for optimal performance
